We all have stories we tell ourselves, about who we are, and what we do, and we believe those stories are static. Stories like "I'm not good at backend", "I can't dance", or "I can’t figure out Vue". When we can recognize those stories, we can also recognize that we are the authors, and we can change our own stories. I had my own stories of “I can’t be a developer because I’m not technical enough”, “I’m not good enough at math to be a programmer”, and “I can’t do handstands, because I’m not an athlete”. In this talk, I will encourage people to rethink their personal stories and reimagine their capabilities not only as developers but also as humans with what I learned about changing my stories.
