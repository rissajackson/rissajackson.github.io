<h3>Summary</h3>
Junior Developers can infuse a team with energy, enthusiasm, and fresh ideas. They also provide an opportunity for experienced engineers to develop and grow their mentorship and leadership abilities! In light of the Great Resignation, with tech companies cutting back with mass layoffs and reconfiguring workplaces, companies and teams that support and empower their junior devs will have an advantage in retention and team culture. But without the right structures in place to nurture junior developers, they can go from being a tremendous asset to a major loss for the team. As an early-career developer, Iâ€™ll share which structures and practices have empowered me and set me up for success, and what can be improved.

<h3>About</h3>
