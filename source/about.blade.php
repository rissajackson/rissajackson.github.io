    <p class="mb-6">I am a Fullstack Software Engineer. I work with Laravel (PHP) and Vue (JavaScript). I'm grateful for all that programming has taught me about problem solving, and love to share what I learn with others. Here is my GitHub: https://github.com/rissajackson</p>

<p class="mb-6">Outside of Software Development I also helped found the 501c3 non-profit Austin Acro Advocates where I served as President for over 2 years. I serve on various committees including the Web, Promotions, Outreach, and Consent & Safety committees. In a previous chapter, I lived in China for two years and taught English. I appreciate all that living abroad taught me.

In my free time you can generally find me doing handstands, partner acrobatics, or dancing.</p>
